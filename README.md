## Getting Started

So as to run our project locally, you need to follow the steps below.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shivam6862/DSA-Visualizer.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages on both backend and frontend folders
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project in frontend using
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. You can now view the project at `http://localhost:3000`

## Features

The DSA Visualizer project includes the following features:<br/>

- Sorting Algorithms: Visualize how various sorting algorithms work, including Bubble sort, Insertion sort , Selection sort , Quicksort, and Mergesort.<br/>

- Graph Algorithms: Create and visualize graphs and apply algorithms such as Breadth first search , Depth first search , Minimum cost path, Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes.<br/>

- Tree Algorithms: Visualize and understand how trees work, PreOrder , Inorder , and PostOrder traversal .<br/>

- Equation Solver Algorithms: Input equations and solve them using different techniques.<br/>

- N-Queens Problem Algorithms: The visualization tool will show all the possible solution to the N-Queen problem using a backtracking algorithm.

- Minesweeper Game: The objective of the game is to clear a minefield without detonating any mines. The game can be played by
  clicking on squares to flag them, and avoiding mines.

- Game2048: The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Usage

To use the DSA Visualizer, simply select the algorithm you wish to visualize from the navigation bar. Follow the instructions to input data or choose a preset input, then click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action. You can also pause, play, or reset the animation as needed. Overall, your DSA Visualizer project is a great resource for students and developers who want to learn more about data structures and algorithms.</br>
